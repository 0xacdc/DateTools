    # TimePeriodCollection
    
     Time period collections serve as loose sets of time periods. They are unorganized unless you decide to sort them, and have their own characteristics like a StartDate and EndDate that are extrapolated from the time periods within. Time period collections allow overlaps within their set of time periods.
 
    [Visit our github page](https://github.com/MatthewYork/DateTools#time-period-collections) for more information.
