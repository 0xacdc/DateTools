    # TimePeriodGroup
 
    Time period groups are the final abstraction of date and time in DateTools. Here, time periods are gathered and organized into something useful. There are two main types of time period groups, ```TimePeriodCollection``` and ```TimePeriodChain```.
 
    [Visit our github page](https://github.com/MatthewYork/DateTools#time-period-groups) for more information.
