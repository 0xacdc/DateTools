## DateTools

DateTools was written to streamline date and time handling in Objective-C. Date and time classes from other languages served as an inspiration for DateTools, especially the [DateTime](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime(v=vs.110).aspx) structure and [Time Period Library](Time Period Library) for .NET. Through these classes and others, DateTools removes the boilerplate required to access date components, handle more nuanced date comparisons, and serve as the foundation for entirely new concepts like Time Periods and their collections.
